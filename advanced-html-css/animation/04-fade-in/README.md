# Fade-In Animation

We've set up an element on the page for this exercise. Load up the page and you'll see a single box that should smoothly appear using a fade-in effect.

Your task is to add animation to this element so that it gradually transitions from invisible to fully visible. Check out the desired outcome below, and notice the smooth and natural appearance of the fade-in as it completes.

### Hints
- You need to use the `opacity` property to create the fading effect.
- The animation should start from `opacity: 0` and end at `opacity: 1`.
- Add the `forwards` keyword to make sure the element stays visible after the animation ends.
- You can experiment with different animation durations (like `2s` or `3s`) to make the effect smoother.

### Self Check

- The element starts invisible and fades in smoothly.
- The fade-in effect happens automatically when the page loads.
- The element remains visible after the animation finishes.
- The animation duration feels natural and pleasing.
