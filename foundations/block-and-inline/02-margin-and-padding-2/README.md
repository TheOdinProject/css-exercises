### Self Check
Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- Just as a reference, the font size in the desired outcome image is 16px. Aim to replicate the image *within reason*.
