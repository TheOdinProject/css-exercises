This would be an image showing the desired outcome:
- A dark header fixed at the top of the viewport containing "Fixed Header" title and navigation links
- The header should remain visible when scrolling
- Main content sections below the header with proper spacing
- Content should not be hidden behind the fixed header

You can create this image by taking a screenshot of the solution.html file in a browser and scrolling to show the fixed behavior.
