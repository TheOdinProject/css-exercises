This would be an image showing the desired outcome:
- A grey container with a black border
- Four colored squares overlapping in a diagonal cascade pattern
- Background layer (red) at top-left
- Middle layer (teal) overlapping background
- Foreground layer (blue) overlapping middle
- Top layer (green) overlapping foreground
- Each layer properly stacked using z-index

You can create this image by taking a screenshot of the solution.html file in a browser.
